--------------------------------------------

v1.0:
- Finalized project.

KNOWN GLITCHES:
- Search by ID not working properly: the program can't seem to find the ID, and creates a new person instead.
- Age goes off the charts when displayed, yet database registers fine.
- Search by appearance prompts don't work properly, values for race are considered invalid.
- An invalid command message displays only on the search functions and generate function, despite the functions running properly.

PATCHES:
-NONE-



v1.1:

KNOWN GLITCHES:
- The search by ID can overload when non-ID is entered, causing a major glitch.

PATCHES:

- Patched searches, they now work. (initial separator was in the loop, causing extra skips).
- Patched the appearance prompts. (ID values were shifted back).
- Generating going over board fixed. (people counter added).
- Fixed searches cutting off parts of people's information (change fin to getline for string values).
